# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview

Roza wants to build a dashboard to showcase the visualization of the bacterial data obtained from volunteers. Specifically, her volunteers are providing the top 10 bacterial species found in their belly button. The hope is to identify a species that can be used to manufacture synthetic beef.

Below is a list of deliverables:

. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart.
. Create a Bubble Chart.
. Create a Gauge Chart.
. Customize the Dashboard.

## Results

The four deliverables were done and the dashboard was customeized to include:

1. Add an image to the jumbotron
2. Add background color to the selection area
3. Add background color to the page.
4. Add more information about the project and Biodiversity.
5. make the webpage mobile-responsive

## Summary

There is no analysis for this project, but the dashboard provides three charts that analysis can be viewed for each volunteer.
